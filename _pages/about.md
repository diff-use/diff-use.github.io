**An ambitious push to make protein motion routine**<br>
Structural biology is ready for its next leap. The Diffuse Project sets out to turn the faint “diffuse” background in X-ray diffraction images into everyday maps of how proteins breathe and bend—information that static crystal structures and even AlphaFold predictions leave behind.

**Why now?**<br>
Static structures have plateaued. AlphaFold and traditional crystallography capture only a single snapshot; the diffuse signal around Bragg peaks holds the hidden information needed to model motion. With room-temperature collection methods improving and GPUs putting heavy computation within reach, the field finally has the tools to make that signal mainstream.
