### An ambitious push to make protein motion routine

Structural biology is ready for its next leap. The DiffUSE Project sets out to turn the faint “diffuse” background in X-ray diffraction images into everyday maps of how proteins breathe and bend—information that static crystal structures and even AlphaFold predictions leave behind.

We believe that changing the way protein motion is understood will require not just new methods but also new ways we work together as scientists. Namely, we are experimenting with how we coordinate efforts across the team and also how we share our scientific process and results. Read more about the philosophy behind the project [here](https://seemay.substack.com/p/from-systems-operators-to-systems).

### Why now?
Static structures have plateaued. AlphaFold and traditional crystallography capture only a single snapshot; the diffuse signal around Bragg peaks holds the hidden information needed to model motion. With room-temperature collection methods improving and GPUs putting heavy computation within reach, the field finally has the tools to make that signal mainstream.

#### A distributed team

We are developing infrastructure alongside science. We are a distributed team experimenting with tightly interconnected workflows.

We’re testing a new ways to fund several parts of the pipeline at once, enabling team members to closely design and coordinate different dimensions. We believe in a more holistic approach to rethinking what changes are possible and scalable.


#### Novel publishing practices

We strive for scientific rigor while ensuring our tools are broadly useful, as widespread adoption across the structural biology community will amplify our impact in both basic and translational science. To achieve this, we commit to opening our processes and [sharing our methods as early as possible](https://diffuse.science/posts/).

##### How we are sharing our science

- [The DiffUSE Project Logbook](http://diffuse.science/logbook): Catalog X-ray datasets, collect notes from synchrotron data collection, share reports from data processing, and post preliminary analysis without filters.

- [The DiffUSE Data Management App](https://app.diffuse.science): Under active development, this site will function to document experiment processing with markdown, images, tables, and rich     metadata fields for comprehensive research tracking across datasets and beamlines.

- [Posts from our Scientists](https://diffuse.science/posts/):  Read direct dispatches from our distributed DiffUSE team.


Specifically, we are experimenting with novel [publishing practices](https://zenodo.org/records/15548989) outside of traditional journals, in accordance with Astera’s publication policy.
