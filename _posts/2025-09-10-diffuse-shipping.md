One of the goals of the Diffuse Project is to collect diffuse scattering from many different samples. To support this goal, the Fraser Lab conducted a thorough inventory of our freezers to identify all available proteins that can be readily crystallized. In addition, we shipped some pre-grown crystals to evaluate their ability to withstand shipping conditions. In total, five different samples, SARS-CoV-2 Mac1, CHIKV Nsp3 WT, CHIKV Nsp3 D31N, FABLE, and Huwe1, were sent to the Ando Lab to ensure that high-quality crystals are available in preparation for future beamtime experiments. 

## Shipping Method

Two types of shipments were prepared. The first was a dry ice box containing four samples stored frozen in solution. For one of these samples, we also included a frozen seed stock essential for crystallization. The second shipment utilized a Crystal Positioning Systems
[thermal shipper](https://www.crystalpositioningsystems.com/product/thermal-shipper/), which maintains a consistent temperature at 20 degrees Celsius. In this box, we provided stocks of protein buffers and precipitant components to maximize reproducibility. Additionally, we included a 96-well crystallization plate containing pre-grown Huwe1 crystals of the fifth sample. We utilized foam inserts to hold the plate for safe transport.

By shipping both frozen proteins and a crystallization plate, we aim to determine which shipping method is most effective for sample preparation and crystal quality. 


## Looking Ahead

The next steps involve the Ando Lab assessing the quality of the shipped crystals to determine whether crystallization plates are a feasible option for sample transport. The Ando Lab will also use the shipped protein to grow new crystals. While we anticipate crystallization to be largely reproducible, some optimization may be necessary to produce crystals of sufficient size for diffuse scattering experiments, especially if plate formats and drop sizes differ from our established methods.

The Fraser Lab remains available to provide troubleshooting support and to ship additional protein as needed. Once we establish confidence in our shipping methods and crystal growth reproducibility, we will also prepare shipments of ligands to conduct soaking experiments.
