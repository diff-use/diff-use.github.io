Most crystallography beamlines are optimized for collecting bright diffraction signals from cryogenically frozen samples to simplify transport and reduce radiation damage. To study protein dynamics with the much weaker and complex diffuse scattering signals, however, we need unfrozen samplesâ€”introducing new challenges. We will develop practical strategies for measuring diffuse scattering at room temperature, reducing background scattering, and addressing experimental constraints to make this accessible for non-specialists.
