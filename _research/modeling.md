To extract meaningful biological insights from diffuse scattering data, accurate modeling is essential. At present, we model protein motions separately from Bragg peaks and from diffuse scattering, then compare them, but the results often disagree. We are developing algorithms that learn directly from experimental data, integrating information from both Bragg and diffuse scattering to develop a unified, consistent model.
