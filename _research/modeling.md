For accurate ensemble prediction, we require ensemble models informed by multiple pieces of experimental data that jointly model proteins, ligands, and solvent.
Currently, we model ensembles from Bragg peaks or Diffuse data and compare them, but they do not match well.
We want to shift towards a paradigm where we directly learn from experimental data, leveraging insights from Bragg and Diffuse scattering, to develop a consistent model of a macromoleculeâ€™s conformational ensemble.
We will test and implement three approaches, each targeting progressively more ambitious outcomes, and determine how best to integrate them.
