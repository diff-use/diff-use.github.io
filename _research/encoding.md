Major challenges lie not just in modeling conformational ensembles, but also in how we represent and encode them.
These representations must serve both human and machine learning needs to enable AI systems that can leverage the full richness of existing and future experimental data and provide interpretable feedback to guide human insight.

This includes how to encode the information within an individual model, how to connect it to other models, and how to relate it to potentially multiple pieces of experimental data.
We have two key components to this project: encoding individual models and building infrastructure to enable the linkage between multiple data sources for optimal downstream use and machine learning applications.
Ultimately, we aim to make the data practical, easy, and adaptable for teams to utilize this rich data for a diverse range of questions.
