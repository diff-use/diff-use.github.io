Correctly representing and encoding the outputs of structural modeling is essential for translating them into biological insight. To enable AI co-driven scientific discovery, these representations must be both machine-readable and human-interpretable to leverage the full richness of existing and future experimental data and provide interpretable feedback to guide human insight. We are developing infrastructure to improve model encoding and data architecture, allowing the others to learn from the rich experimental data collected in this project.
