With only a handful of [publicly available diffuse scattering datasets today](https://diffuse.science/logbook/data/), we will lead an effort to populate a public database with compelling, high-quality examples, expanding the resources available to the community and lowering barriers for others to analyze, interpret, and apply diffuse scattering data in their research.
